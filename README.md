After cloning, change into project directory and run "npm install". 
This will download the node modules needed from the package.json.

- I recommend installing nodemon so you don't have to restart the server after every change.
      - "npm install -g nodemon"
      - then to have it serve the app and watch for changes run  "nodemon server.js"
